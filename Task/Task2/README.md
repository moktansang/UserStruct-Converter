1. Before testing the tool make sure that a database is running on localhost:5432. Database should have a db with name "temp". If any configuration needs to be changed related to db connection then refer to line 13 and 14 in main.go and update it as required.
2. Once the database is ready to connect use the binary to test the cli or go run command can also be used. This cli tool requires one non-flag argument to create or drop the table.
3.  Use `./Task2 create` or `go run main.go create` to create a table with User struct. Check the database and verify that table is created. A log message "creating table" should be printed if there are no errors.
4.  Use `./Task2 drop` or `go run main.go drop` to drop the table for cleanup or testing again. Check the database and verify that table is dropped. A log message "dropping table" should be printed if there are no errors.
